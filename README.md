# CTFs

Here's where I will put all my CTFs Writeups

Student in a third year Télécommunication and Networking bachelor's degree, I love trying CTFs during my week-ends.
I constantly learn new things, new ways of solving problems and searching hard to brandish flags from the darkness.

Good at (but still learning) : 

OSINT, Steganography, Reversing, Forensics

(Really) Bad at : 

Web, Cryptography, PWN, Misc
